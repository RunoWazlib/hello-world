DO NOT DIRECTLY EDIT IN "main" BRANCH, use branches
Other branches serve as experiment area to make edits on the "main" branch.

Those branches can be "committed" to push the change to the "main" branch.

branch:main = "Production" or final product
Commits = Saved Changes
Pull Requests = Proposal to push edits (request for review) to the "main branch" 
diffs = differences in content from both branches
  (Additions = Green : Subtractions = Red)

After branch changes have been made, the experiment branch can be deleted



To do a "pull request":
1. go to "Pull Requests" tab
2. click "New Pull Request"
3. For comparison, select the branch to compare with another branch 
    ex. (branch:main) <- ("Insert Branch Name Here")
4. Look over changes, compare additions and subtractions
5. click "Create Pull Request"
6. Provide description and post
